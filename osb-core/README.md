# cf-service-broker-core
This project provides core functionalities for Cloud Foundry Service Broker. It needs deployment services and a persistence service (see https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-deployment and https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-persistence) as well as a concrete implementation of service binding routines for a concrete service (for examples see https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-example and https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-elasticsearch).
